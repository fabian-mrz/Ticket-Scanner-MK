## Purpose

This system was built to:

- Provide an easy QR code check-in interface
- Allow modular management of seats, formats, and ticket types
- Support CSV import from the Events Tickets WordPress plugin, Excel export, and printing of sold tickets

## Main Components

### Ticket Import from WordPress (`final.py`)

Automates the ticket retrieval process from a WordPress site using Selenium:
- Logs into the WordPress admin
- Extracts ticket data from tables provided by the Events Tickets management plugin
- Imports data into SQLite

**Key functions:**
  - `setup_driver`
  - `parse_table_to_csv`
  - `check_for_new_tickets`
  - `process_tickets`

---

### API Server (`api.py`)

A FastAPI-based backend that handles:
- Ticket listing, editing, and validation
- QR code generation and printing
- Log management
- File uploads

**Example API Endpoints:**
- `GET /tickets`
- `POST /tickets/upload`
- `GET /api/logs`
- `POST /tickets/print`
